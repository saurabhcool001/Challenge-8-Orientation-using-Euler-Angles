# Challenge-8-Orientation-using-Euler-Angles

Objectives:

With your preferred programming language/framework/engine(C++, C#, Python), “hard-code”(ie, not using existing libraries) a function that changes the orientation of an object, based on Euler angles.

Start with a simple triangle (with 3 vertices and 3 lines).

Create three sliders as the parameters of the Euler angles of an object in 3D space.

Use the change of orientation function and the 3 sliders as input to control the orientation of the triangle.

Explore the use of the 3 parameters, and create a scenario of gimbal-lock.
